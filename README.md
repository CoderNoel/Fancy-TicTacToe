# Fancy Naughts & Crosses

A modified version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (or Naughts & Crosses) game developed as part of the CSSE1001 course at the University of Queensland.

## Description

This game is similar to the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe but introduces an interesting twist: each player has markers of different sizes. Players can place a larger marker on top of a smaller marker already present on the board. The game ends either when a player fills a row, column, or diagonal with their markers or when the game reaches a stalemate.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their markers.
3. A player can place any of their markers on an empty cell or place a larger marker on top of a smaller one already on the board.
4. The game concludes when a player wins by forming a line or when no further moves can be made.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `python a1.py` to start the game.
